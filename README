The Cabal library package
=========================

Installation instructions for the DSTM library
===============================================

Installing as a user (no root or administer access)
---------------------------------------------------

    ghc --make Setup
    ./Setup configure --user
    ./Setup build
    ./Setup install

Note the use of the `--user` flag at the configure step.

Compiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works on
Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.

This will install into `$HOME/.cabal/` on unix and into
`$Documents and Settings\$User\Application Data\cabal\` on Windows
If you want to install elsewhere use the `--prefix=` flag at the
configure step.


Installing as root / Administrator
----------------------------------

    ghc --make Setup
    ./Setup configure
    ./Setup build
    sudo ./Setup install

Compiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works on
Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.

This will install into `/usr/local` on unix and on Windows it will
install into `$ProgramFiles/Haskell`. If you want to install
elsewhere use the `--prefix=` flag at the configure step.
